Subset Maximization

You are given an array A of length N. You need to find the maximum length of the subset of given array such 
that the frequency all the elements present in the subset are equal.

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer, denoting the value of N.
The second line of input contains N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array A.
Output Format

Print the maximum length of the subset of the array A in which frequency of all the elements present in that subset is equal.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^5

Sample Input
5
1 2 2 3 3
Sample Output
4
Explanation
{2 ,2 ,3 ,3} is the required subset with maximum length of 4.

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. However, this is not enough 
to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
