Gifts

Alice wants to buy some gifts for Bob. The shopkeeper has N types of gifts. 
Each type of gift has a distinct price. But shopkeeper has only 2 gifts of each type. 
Alice has a budget of B units. A gift-set is a collection of gifts Alice bought. 
Alice wants to count the number of possible non-empty gift-sets she can buy by spending less than or equal to B. 
Two gift-sets are different if there is at least one gift which is present in one gift-set but not in other. 
For each type of gift, both the gifts are identical.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, denoting N and B.
Next line contains N space-separated integers, where the ith integer denotes the price of the ith type of gift.
 

Output Format

Print an integer, denoting the number of non-empty gift-sets she can buy.
 

Constraints
1 <= N <= 14
1 <= B, P[i] <= 10^9

Sample Input
2 9
8 3
Sample Output
3
Explanation
Possible gift-sets are:

{gift of type 1} with cost equal to 8 units.

{gift of type 2, gift of type 2} with cost equal to 6 units.

{gift of type 2} with cost equal to 3 units.

Note: Your code should be able to convert the sample input into the sample output. 
However, this is not enough to pass the challenge, because the code will be run on multiple test cases. 
Therefore, your code must solve this problem statement.
